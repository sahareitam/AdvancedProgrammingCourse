- **Modularity**: Clean separation between data definitions, logic, and user interface.
- **Efficient Code**: Demonstrates use of memory and global constants effectively.

## Project Structure
- **`Pokemon.h`**: Header file for the Pokémon entity.
- **`Pokemon.c`**: Implementation of Pokémon-related functions.
- **`Pokedex.c`**: The main program for managing the Pokémon database.
- **`Defs.h`**: Global definitions and constants.

## Requirements
- A C compiler, such as GCC.
- A Unix-based system or any environment supporting C compilation.

## How to Compile and Run
